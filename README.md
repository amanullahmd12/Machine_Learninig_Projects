# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! Here, I've showcased some of my interesting projects related to anomaly detection and customer segmentation. Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, and analysis. Feel free to explore the projects and learn more about the techniques used.

## Anomaly Detection

### Description

The Anomaly Detection project focuses on detecting anomalous patterns or outliers within a dataset. Anomalies can be indicative of rare events, errors, or malicious activities. This project showcases my ability to preprocess data, select appropriate algorithms, and evaluate their performance.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Algorithm selection and training
- Anomaly detection techniques evaluation
- Visualization of anomalies

## Customer Segmentation

### Description

Customer Segmentation is a technique used to group similar customers based on their purchasing behavior, preferences, and other relevant attributes. In this project, I've demonstrated my skills in clustering techniques to segment customers for targeted marketing strategies.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Features

- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- K-means clustering algorithm
- Visualization of customer segments
- Insights and recommendations based on segments

## Getting Started

To explore these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Machine_Learning_Projects.git
2. Navigate to the respective project folders:
- For Anomaly Detection: `cd Anomaly_Detection`
- For Customer Segmentation: `cd Customer_Segmentation`

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (`*.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

4. Run the code cells in the notebooks to see the project in action, understand the techniques used, and analyze the results.
